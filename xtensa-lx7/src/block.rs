//! Basic-block interpreter.
//!
//! `step()` pays the full per-instruction price — interrupt check, decode-cache probe and
//! validation, cycle/instruction accounting — on every instruction. Measured on real firmware,
//! that scaffolding is a third of run time and no single piece of it is removable, so this
//! module amortises it: a *block* is a straight-line run of pre-decoded instructions ending
//! at a control transfer or at anything that changes interrupt/timer state, and the checks
//! run once per block.
//!
//! What stays exact:
//! - **Timer interrupts**: a block never runs past the point where a `CCOMPARE` would match
//!   (the distance bounds the block), so the interrupt is flagged at the same instruction
//!   boundary as before. Reads and writes of `CCOUNT`/`CCOMPARE*` are forced to start a
//!   block, so they always see exact time.
//! - **Peripheral interrupts**: the bus reports when a register write may have changed an
//!   interrupt line (`Bus::block_break`) and the block ends there, so delivery latency is
//!   unchanged. Instructions that alter `PS`, `INTENABLE` or interrupt state end blocks.
//! - **Control flow**: after each instruction the actual `pc` is compared with the fall-through
//!   address, so taken branches and exceptions leave the block immediately. The WASM JIT
//!   may retain a safe hardware-loop prefix across backedges within the same budget; it
//!   validates code versions and observer boundaries before each repeat.
//! - **Self-modifying code**: a block remembers the write-version of the (at most two) pages
//!   it was decoded from and is rebuilt when either changes. Stores from within a block
//!   into its own remaining instructions take effect at the next block entry — on silicon
//!   that case needs `isync` anyway, and `isync` ends a block.
//! - **Window overflow** checks stay per instruction; they are the one check that matters.
