# EX219: LED routing and DMA output

Base: upstream main `017af524`. Related EX205 provides CPU-fed compact RMT and
board pin transport. This change adds mirrored peripheral routes, S3 TX3 DMA
symbols, and C6 parallel output. Independent of EX218's opt-in GPIO waveform decoder.

## Behavior

RMT delivery iterates every valid GPIO matrix route, using main's `PinRoutes`
for IO_MUX, chip-specific masks, output inversion and output-enable selection.
Two enabled pins on the same signal each receive a frame. A disabled
software-enable route, inverted route, or non-GPIO mux function does not.

S3 stages finite DMA chains when RMT/GDMA registers are written. It reuses the
existing `gather_dma_out` Result-based helper and bounded descriptor walker.
Automatic owner writeback is gated once in this shared helper. Channel 3 consumes
the staged symbols through the existing timed RMT transmitter. DMA mode bypasses
CPU-fed RMT memory exhaustion and threshold interrupts. FIFO reset and disabling
DMA discard staged symbols; starvation waits for more data.

C6 stages finite PARLIO chains on PARLIO/GDMA/PCR TX-clock writes, including
prefill while the TX clock is disabled. A single C6 gather helper, also used by
SPI2 and AES, owns descriptor validation, bounded traversal and writeback.
Malformed OUT chains report a GDMA error without delivering partial SPI/AES output.
A configured start, complete payload and enabled clock produce lane samples and
TX EOF. Packing widths 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16, both bit orders, mirrored lanes and
interrupt enable/clear are modeled. A free function next to `Ws2812Chain` converts
lane samples to the existing board `rmt_frame` API, iterating routes directly.
It shares named WS2812 timing constants with the independent EX218 implementation.
Completed PARLIO data stores samples only; width and clock remain on the peripheral.

Both staging paths honor descriptor ownership checks and automatic owner
writeback, preserve descriptor EOF addresses, and set DONE/EOF/TOTAL_EOF or
DSCR_ERR. Invalid descriptors, lengths, alignment, buffer addresses and cyclic
chains cannot produce unbounded output. S3 queues at most 4096 pixels' symbols
plus one end marker; C6 queues at most 65535 bytes. These are emulator limits.

## Idle path

No DMA pump or PARLIO callback was added to a device tick. Staging runs only on
relevant register writes. RMT retains its existing idle return. PARLIO uses the
existing optional-device interrupt cache and has no clock callback. New fields
are appended to their structs. No CPU benchmark was run.

IDF v4.4.8 S3 `include/soc/rmt_struct.h:126` calls bits 25–31 reserved;
v5.5.4 explicitly names DMA_ACCESS_EN at bit 25. This port follows the IDF 5.x
DMA path, not an Arduino-ESP32 2.x DMA claim. GDMA writeback, owner-check and
interrupt bits match v4.4.8 `include/soc/gdma_reg.h:594-687`. C6 is IDF 5.x.
The PCR header's reset prose and unpack-order prose contain ambiguous values;
the LL reset sequence and `parlio_types.h` enum resolve the modeled meanings.
No hardware verification is claimed.

## Verification

`checks.json` records the final required command results on Rust 1.99.0. Both
workspace invocations use an empty HOME. The ignored-inclusive invocation sets
only ESP32SIM_ROM_DIR among emulator variables, to the checkout's `web/wasm/fw`;
the plain invocation has no emulator variables. CARGO_HOME and RUSTUP_HOME retain
access to the toolchain. The default toolchain is unchanged.

Inputs and source-test hashes are in `inputs.json`. Demo assets were obtained
with `tools/fetch-demo-assets.sh --no-linux` inside this checkout. No firmware
fixtures are copied from another checkout or required from a developer machine.
Existing goldens are unchanged. This branch does not modify JIT code.

The focused tests assert two independent RMT frame deliveries on each chip;
S3 multi-descriptor symbol output and RMT interrupt state; C6 clock-off prefill,
three routed outputs, both lane colours, descriptor handback and source-63 IRQ
assertion/clear. Additional tests cover widths, bit order, reset, starvation,
malformed descriptors and queue bounds. The shared C6 gather regression pins SPI
payloads, AES-128 zero-key/zero-input ciphertext, owner handback and completion
interrupt state with automatic writeback enabled and disabled. These are register-level workloads, not
a claim of running a particular FastLED or NeoPixel firmware release.

`mutations.json` records 24 exact mutations and the tests that kill them, including
both MMIO staging hooks, multi-route fanout, DMA mode, reset, ownership, lengths,
writeback selection, EOF interrupts, queue bounds and PARLIO packing/clock/IRQ.
Each changed source is restored before the next mutation. Every mutation fails
an assertion in a previously passing focused test.

## Limits

Only finite DMA chains are supported. DMA staging and descriptor completion occur
at MMIO boundaries; FIFO backpressure, concurrent guest buffer modification and
continuous DMA rings are not modeled. PARLIO completes transactionally rather
than after elapsed wire time. It models TX data output, not RX, external input
clocks, valid-signal gating or every PCR reset interaction. Reserved widths and
odd byte counts for 16-bit samples do not complete.

WS2812 high widths of 150–1100 ns, a 550 ns bit split and 50 us reset detection are
inferred decoder policy. A transaction boundary also terminates a parallel frame.
These tolerances and completion rules are not silicon timing claims.
